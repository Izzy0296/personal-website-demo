    <p>Traveling is one of my favorite things to do. 
        I've been to Europe a few times and fell in love with it.
        I have had the opportunty to travel to London, Germany, and Amsterdam in the past.
         I got a chance to gain new perspectives in life and meet new friends.
        From trying different food to to exploring new cultures, everything was an amazing experience to be a part of.

    <p>Music is everything to me. It begins when I wake up and travels all the way until I go to bed.
